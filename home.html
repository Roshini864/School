                    <p>The most prominent thing I always feel about Meridian is that the school lives by its ethos -
                        connecting the heart and mind by promoting both intellectual and emotional development. The
                        Faculty is top talent in the industry and reflects &nbsp;in their teaching while the emphasis on
                        self learning encourages experimentation vs rote learning. Parents involvement is highly
                        promoted and expected, making this a valuable partnership. Meridian is a beacon amongst the
                        education system of the city and state, takes the lead in several avenues like the recently
                        concluded Online inter-school Literary and Cultural Fest “Melange"</p>

                        <p>What defines a good school? As defined by Joanne Yatvin , a good school is a school that
                            creates a sense of community that permits personal expression within a framework of social
                            responsibility. It focuses on learnings that grow through use, such as communication skills,
                            decision making, craftsmanship and group interaction. It makes children think for themselves
                            as people who find strength, nourishment and joy in learning. Our journey at Meridian
                            started when Krittika joined the school in 2007 as a ‘mid-term’ admission in PP1 ( pri
                            primary). I remember, the day, as clearly as though it happened yesterday. When the
                            interview was done and Usha Reddy Ma’am, asked me &nbsp;when Krittika could join the school,
                            I had queried, whether Krittika would be required to go through an assessment. She looked at
                            Krittika and asked her “Do you want to join my school?” Krittika, her eyes shining and
                            wearing her widest smile ever, just nodded. Ma’am then said &nbsp;“that’s all we need - big
                            bright eyes and a wide smile. The rest is for us to do.” That sentence defines our journey.
                            Krittika is poised to leave school next year. She’s still got her big bright smile and
                            shining eyes intact. Through the years whether it was camping in school, going on field
                            trips, participating in various events, singing &amp; dancing on stage, giving exams, being
                            coached when the results weren’t great to sharing high fives when they were, representing
                            the school in sporting &amp; cultural events, to participating in the MUN and holding
                            leadership roles like the sports secretary and most recently the head girl, she’s
                            experienced it all. &nbsp;She has grown and blossomed into this confident child who has
                            found strength, nourishment and joy in learning at Meridian. As we look back, we feel so
                            good that our child is a Meridianite, where she has been taught to connect her heart and her
                            mind to all that she does. &nbsp;Along with her I have seen her classmates become incredible
                            young people. I’ve also marveled at how the teaching staff, admin staff and heads of school
                            &nbsp;don’t seem to age. Thank you all for being incredible. For helping us cope as a family

                            and contribution she will attempt &nbsp;to say “ Thank you – Meridian school for Boys and

                            is a school that creates a sense of community that permits personal expression within a
                            framework of social responsibility. It focuses on learnings that grow through use, such as
                            communication skills, decision making, craftsmanship and group interaction. It makes
                            children think for themselves as people who find strength, nourishment and joy in learning.
                            Our journey at Meridian started when Krittika joined the school in 2007 as a ‘mid-term’
                            admission in PP1 ( pri primary). I remember, the day, as clearly as though it happened
                            yesterday. When the interview was done and Usha Reddy Ma’am, asked me &nbsp;when Krittika
                            could join the school, I had queried, whether Krittika would be required to go through an
                            assessment. She looked at Krittika and asked her “Do you want to join my school?” Krittika,
                            her eyes shining and wearing her widest smile ever, just nodded. Ma’am then said
                            &nbsp;“that’s all we need - big bright eyes and a wide smile. The rest is for us to do.”
                            That sentence defines our journey. Krittika is poised to leave school next year. She’s still
